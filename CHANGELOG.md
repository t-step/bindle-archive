# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-kit are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html):

- **major** — a breaking change to how the toolkit installs or is structured
  (e.g. `install.sh` layout/behavior changes that need action on your part).
- **minor** — a new skill, agent, command, or capability.
- **patch** — a fix or tweak to something that already exists.

Add notes under **Unreleased** as you go; `bin/release.sh` rolls them into a
dated, versioned section at release time.
