# check-private-info.sh — scan committed/staged content for personal info that
# must never land in a repo: private-relay emails, local home paths, vault
# paths, pasted chat transcripts, private scratch files, and your own denylist
# terms. Offline, plain grep, deliberately boring — read it, edit it.
#
# This catches PERSONAL info (things that identify you); secret material
# (keys, tokens) is covered by detect-private-key and Gitleaks (.gitleaks.toml).
# See docs/privacy-boundaries.md for the full model.
#
# Usage:
#   bin/check-private-info.sh              # scan all tracked files
#   bin/check-private-info.sh FILE...      # scan specific files (pre-commit)
#   bin/check-private-info.sh --self-test  # prove the patterns catch fixtures
#   bin/check-private-info.sh --audit-denylist  # prove each denylist term
#                                          # has ZERO tracked hits (#271)
#
# Personal denylist: one term per line (case-insensitive fixed strings; '#'
# comments) at private-denylist.txt in the NOTES HOME ROOT — $BINDLE_NOTES_DIR
# when set, else ~/.bindle — or point BINDLE_DENYLIST at another file to
# override. Deprecated CLAUDE_KIT_DENYLIST, CLAUDE_KIT_NOTES_DIR, and
# ~/.claude-kit aliases remain supported. The denylist itself is personal —
# never commit it.
#
# A clean run reports whether a denylist was loaded: passing with none loaded
# means the PATTERNS held, not that your personal terms were checked.
#
# False positives: append 'private-ok' to the specific line to vouch for it,
# or add a path to SKIP_FILES below for files that must discuss these
# patterns (this script, the Gitleaks config).
